- Use msg.sender instead of state variable while transfering nft,token etc.

- Use simple value types like uint256 and address instead of complex types.

- Avoid expensive operations like exponentiation and large calculations.

- Minimize storage reads and writes, and batch transactions.

- Apply modifiers to reuse code and make efficient state changes.

- Limit external calls and use view and pure functions.

- Use gas estimation tools and consider contract upgradability.

- Utilize shared libraries to avoid redundant code.

- Organize data efficiently and consider state channels for off-chain activities.
