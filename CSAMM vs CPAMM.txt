Constant Product AMM (e.g., Uniswap):

1 . Product of token quantities remains constant.
2 . Price changes follow a curved relationship.
3 . Impermanent loss can occur, incentivizing arbitrage.
4 . Liquidity providers supply both tokens, earn fees.
5 . Trades can have significant price impact.


Constant Sum AMM (e.g., Bancor protocol):

1 . Sum of token values remains constant.
2 . Price changes are linear and more predictable.
3 . Impermanent loss might be reduced.
4 . Protocol adjusts token quantities to maintain balance.
5 . Liquidity providers supply one token, earn fees.
6 . Trades have relatively stable price impact.
